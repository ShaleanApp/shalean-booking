## ‚ùå Critical Issues Found

### 1. **CRITICAL: Server/Client Component Import Error**
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Breaks test-db page and potentially other functionality  
**Location:** `src/lib/database.ts` ‚Üí `src/lib/supabase.ts` ‚Üí `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`

**Problem:**
```
Error: You're importing a component that needs "next/headers". That only works in a Server Component which is not supported in the pages/ directory.
```

**Root Cause:**
The `database.ts` file imports from `supabase.ts` which includes server-side code (`next/headers`), but `database.ts` is being used in client components like `test-db/page.tsx`.

**Files Affected:**
- `src/lib/database.ts`
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- `src/app/test-db/page.tsx`
- Any client component using `DatabaseService`

**Fix Required:**
- Separate client and server database utilities
- Create client-specific database functions that don't import server code
- Update components to use appropriate client/server utilities

### 2. **Environment Variable Issues**
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** May cause runtime errors in production

**Problems:**
- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in auth redirects (fallback to localhost)
- Some environment variables may not be properly configured for production

**Files Affected:**
- `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` (line 62)
- `src/app/auth/register/page.tsx` (line 62)

### 3. **Currency Formatting Inconsistency**
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** User experience and pricing clarity

**Problem:**
- ServiceBrowser uses USD formatting (`$150.00`)
- ServiceSelectionStep uses NGN formatting (`‚Ç¶150.00`)
- Admin dashboard uses NGN formatting
- Inconsistent currency display across the application

**Files Affected:**
- `src/components/services/ServiceBrowser.tsx` (line 84-88)
- `src/components/booking/steps/ServiceSelectionStep.tsx` (line 215, 284)
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` (line 145-150)

### 4. **Missing Error Handling**
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Poor user experience when things go wrong

**Problems:**
- Limited error boundaries
- Some API calls lack proper error handling
- No fallback UI for failed service loading

### 5. **Booking Flow Incomplete**
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Core functionality not working

**Problems:**
- Service selection step has database connection issues
- Payment integration not fully tested
- Booking confirmation flow needs validation
- Address management functionality not tested

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues

### 1. **Performance Concerns**
- No loading states for some components
- Potential for large bundle sizes with all UI components
- No image optimization implemented

### 2. **Security Considerations**
- API endpoints need rate limiting
- Input validation needs strengthening
- CORS configuration may need review

### 3. **Accessibility**
- Missing ARIA labels in some components
- Color contrast may need verification
- Keyboard navigation not fully tested
