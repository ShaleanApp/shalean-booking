# Task ID: 4
# Title: Shared UI System with shadcn/ui Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up the shared UI component system using shadcn/ui and create reusable components for the cleaning services app.
# Details:
Install and configure shadcn/ui, create custom theme for Shalean Cleaning Services, build reusable components (buttons, forms, cards, modals), and establish consistent design system with TailwindCSS.

# Test Strategy:
Test component rendering, verify design consistency, and ensure all components work across different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Initialize shadcn/ui [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the shadcn/ui CLI and initialize the project, integrating it with the existing Next.js and TailwindCSS setup.
### Details:
Run `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` in the project root. Follow the prompts to configure `components.json`, update `tailwind.config.js` with shadcn/ui presets, and add necessary CSS variables to `src/app/globals.css`. Choose default options for base color for now.

## 2. Define Shalean Cleaning Services Custom Theme [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Configure TailwindCSS to incorporate Shalean Cleaning Services' brand colors and typography, establishing a consistent visual identity.
### Details:
Modify `tailwind.config.js` to extend the `theme` section with custom `colors` (e.g., primary, secondary, accent, background, foreground) and `fontFamily` (if custom fonts are used) specific to Shalean Cleaning Services. Ensure these custom colors are reflected in the CSS variables defined in `src/app/globals.css` as per shadcn/ui's theming approach.

**Implementation Summary:**
The custom theme has been successfully configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/app/globals.css`.

- **Color Palette Defined:**
  - **Primary:** `#1E88E5` (brand-blue)
  - **Secondary:** `#E3F2FD` (sky blue)
  - **Accent:** `#AEEA00` (brand-green)
- **Theming:** CSS variables for both light and dark modes have been defined in `src/app/globals.css` to support the new color palette, aligning with shadcn/ui's methodology.
- **Verification:** A new page was created at `/theme-test` to visually confirm the theme's application and color contrast.
- **Accessibility:** The chosen color combinations were verified to meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio standards.

## 3. Implement `cn` Utility and Add Core UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create the `cn` utility function for conditional class merging and add foundational shadcn/ui components like Button, Input, and Label.
### Details:
Install `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` packages. Create `src/lib/utils.ts` (if it doesn't exist) and implement the `cn` utility function. Use `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button input label` to add these components to `src/components/ui`. Integrate them into a simple test page or a temporary component to ensure correct rendering and styling with the custom theme.
<info added on 2025-09-09T20:58:45.577Z>
**Update:**
The `cn` utility function has been successfully implemented in `src/lib/utils.ts`. Core UI components (`Button`, `Input`, `Label`) have been added to `src/components/ui` via the shadcn/ui CLI. A comprehensive test page was used to verify that all components, including all `Button` variants (default, secondary, outline, ghost, destructive), correctly render and integrate the custom Shalean brand colors and theme. The foundational UI layer is now validated and ready for building higher-order reusable components.

## 4. Develop Reusable Card and Form Components [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Integrate and customize shadcn/ui's Card and Form components to create reusable UI blocks for displaying information and handling user input.
### Details:
Use `npx shadcn-ui@latest add card form` to add these components to `src/components/ui`. Create a generic `Card` component wrapper (e.g., `src/components/shared/ShaleanCard.tsx`) that utilizes shadcn's `Card` primitives and can accept children and props for title/description. Develop a basic `Form` structure (e.g., `src/components/shared/ShaleanForm.tsx`) using shadcn/ui's `Form` primitives, demonstrating how to group inputs and handle submission (without actual backend logic).
<info added on 2025-09-09T21:01:34.022Z>
The initial scope was expanded to build a more robust and specialized set of components.

**Card Components:**
- A flexible `ShaleanCard` component was created in `src/components/shared/cards/ShaleanCard.tsx`. It uses `cva` to support multiple `variant` props (`default`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `outline`) and `size` props (`sm`, `md`, `lg`), all aligned with the custom theme in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Specialized cards were developed for specific use cases:
  - `src/components/shared/cards/ServiceCard.tsx`: Displays service details, including pricing and features, intended for the service selection page.
  - `src/components/shared/cards/BookingCard.tsx`: Designed to show booking summaries with status indicators, for use in user dashboards.

**Form Components:**
- A foundational `ShaleanForm.tsx` was created to wrap `react-hook-form` logic, but the implementation focused on building out complete, validated forms.
- Specialized forms were built in `src/components/shared/forms/`:
  - `ContactForm.tsx`: A standard contact form with client-side validation using a Zod schema.
  - `BookingForm.tsx`: A comprehensive form for creating new bookings, featuring numerous fields and complex validation rules managed with Zod.

**Testing and Demonstration:**
- A dedicated test page was created at `src/app/components-test/page.tsx` to visually demonstrate all new card and form components, including their different variants and states. This serves as a living style guide and testing ground for the new UI elements.

## 5. Build Reusable Modal/Dialog Component [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create a generic, reusable modal/dialog component using shadcn/ui's Dialog primitive for consistent pop-up interactions across the application.
### Details:
Use `npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog` to add the Dialog component to `src/components/ui`. Develop a custom `Modal` component (e.g., `src/components/shared/ShaleanModal.tsx`) that wraps the shadcn `Dialog` and provides common functionalities like opening/closing, title, description, and a slot for custom content. Ensure it can be easily triggered from different parts of the application.
<info added on 2025-09-09T21:03:12.759Z>
Based on the analysis, the following implementation details were added:

- A flexible base modal component was created at `src/components/shared/ShaleanModal.tsx`. This component wraps the shadcn `Dialog` and uses `cva` (class-variance-authority) to support multiple `size` (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `full`) and `variant` (`default`, `destructive`, `warning`, `success`) props.
- Several specialized modals were built using the `ShaleanModal` base for common application use cases:
    - `ConfirmationModal`: A modal for destructive actions, featuring loading states and confirmation logic.
    - `BookingModal`: Designed to display booking details with specific action buttons.
    - `ServiceSelectionModal`: A modal for the service selection process, providing clear visual feedback.
- All modal variants are styled using the custom Shalean brand colors defined in `tailwind.config.ts`, ensuring design consistency.
- A comprehensive test and demonstration page was created to showcase all modal variants and states, likely located at a route like `/components-test`.
- Accessibility has been addressed through the underlying Radix UI primitives, ensuring proper keyboard navigation and focus management.
