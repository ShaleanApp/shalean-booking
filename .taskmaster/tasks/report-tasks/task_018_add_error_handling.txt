# Task 18: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling and UX Improvements

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Pending
## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

## Problem Description
Limited error handling and poor user experience when things go wrong:
- Limited error boundaries
- Some API calls lack proper error handling
- No fallback UI for failed service loading
- Poor error messages for users
- No loading states for some operations

## Files Affected
- All API route handlers
- Client components making API calls
- Service loading components
- Payment processing components
- Authentication components

## Solution Required
1. **Add error boundaries**
   - Create React error boundary components
   - Wrap critical sections with error boundaries
   - Provide fallback UI for errors

2. **Improve API error handling**
   - Add proper error handling to all API calls
   - Return meaningful error messages
   - Handle network errors gracefully

3. **Add loading states**
   - Add loading indicators for all async operations
   - Prevent multiple submissions during loading
   - Provide visual feedback for long operations

4. **Improve user feedback**
   - Add toast notifications for success/error states
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Implementation Steps
1. Create error boundary components
2. Add error boundaries to critical sections
3. Update API calls with proper error handling
4. Add loading states to all async operations
5. Implement toast notification system
6. Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
7. Test error scenarios and user experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and handle component errors
- [ ] All API calls have proper error handling
- [ ] Loading states are shown for all async operations
- [ ] Users receive clear feedback for all operations
- [ ] Failed operations can be retried
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable

## Testing
- Test error boundary functionality
- Test API error handling with network failures
- Test loading states during operations
- Test toast notifications
- Test retry mechanisms
- Test user experience during error scenarios

## Dependencies
- None (can be done independently)

## Notes
This significantly improves user experience and makes the application more robust. Should be completed after critical functionality is working.
