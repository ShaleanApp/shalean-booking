# Task 17: Complete and Test Full Booking Flow Functionality

## Priority: High
## Status: Pending
## Estimated Time: 3-4 hours

## Problem Description
The booking flow is incomplete and needs thorough testing:
- Service selection step has database connection issues
- Payment integration not fully tested
- Booking confirmation flow needs validation
- Address management functionality not tested
- End-to-end booking process needs verification

## Files Affected
- `src/components/booking/MultiStepBookingForm.tsx`
- `src/components/booking/steps/ServiceSelectionStep.tsx`

- `src/components/booking/steps/PaymentStep.tsx`
- `src/app/api/bookings/create/route.ts`
- `src/components/payment/PaystackPayment.tsx`

## Solution Required
1. **Fix service selection step**
   - Resolve database connection issues (depends on Task 14)
   - Ensure services load correctly
   - Test service selection and quantity updates

2. **Test payment integration**
   - Verify Paystack integration works
   - Test payment flow end-to-end
   - Handle payment success/failure scenarios

3. **Complete booking confirmation**
   - Test booking creation API
   - Verify email confirmation sending
   - Test booking status updates

4. **Test address management**
   - Test address creation and selection
   - Verify address validation
   - Test address updates and deletion

## Implementation Steps
1. Fix service selection step (after Task 14 completion)
2. Test and fix payment integration
3. Test booking creation API thoroughly
4. Test email confirmation sending
5. Test address management functionality
6. Perform end-to-end booking flow testing
7. Fix any issues found during testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Service selection step works without errors
- [ ] Payment integration processes payments correctly
- [ ] Booking creation API works reliably
- [ ] Email confirmations are sent successfully
- [ ] Address management functions properly
- [ ] Complete booking flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Error handling works for all failure scenarios

## Testing
- Test service selection with various combinations
- Test payment with test cards
- Test booking creation with different data
- Test email sending functionality
- Test address management operations
- Perform complete booking flow test
- Test error scenarios and recovery

## Dependencies

## Notes
