# Task 19: Implement Performance Optimizations and Code Splitting

## Priority: Medium
## Status: Completed
## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours

## Problem Description
Performance concerns identified during testing:
- No loading states for some components
- Potential for large bundle sizes with all UI components
- No image optimization implemented
- No code splitting for better performance
- No caching strategies implemented

## Files Affected
- `next.config.ts`
- All page components
- Image components
- Bundle configuration
- Caching strategies

## Solution Required
1. **Implement code splitting**
   - Add dynamic imports for large components
   - Split routes into separate chunks
   - Lazy load non-critical components

2. **Add image optimization**
   - Use Next.js Image component
   - Implement proper image sizing
   - Add lazy loading for images

3. **Optimize bundle size**
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Implement tree shaking
   - Optimize imports

4. **Add caching strategies**
   - Implement API response caching
   - Add browser caching headers
   - Cache static assets

5. **Add performance monitoring**
   - Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Add performance metrics
   - Monitor bundle size

## Implementation Steps
1. Update `next.config.ts` with optimization settings
2. Add dynamic imports for large components
3. Replace img tags with Next.js Image component
4. Implement API response caching
5. Add performance monitoring
6. Test performance improvements
7. Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Code splitting reduces initial bundle size
- [x] Images are optimized and lazy loaded
- [x] API responses are cached appropriately
- [x] Core Web Vitals are in 'Good' range
- [x] Bundle size is optimized
- [x] Performance monitoring is in place

## Testing
- Test page load times
- Test image loading performance
- Test API response times
- Test Core Web Vitals scores
- Test bundle size reduction
- Test caching effectiveness

## Dependencies
- None (can be done independently)

## Notes
This improves application performance and user experience. Should be completed after core functionality is working and stable.
