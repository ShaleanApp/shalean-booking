# Task 16: Fix Environment Variable Configuration Issues

## Priority: High
## Status: Pending
## Estimated Time: 1 hour

## Problem Description
Environment variable configuration issues that may cause runtime errors in production:
- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in auth redirects (fallback to localhost)
- Some environment variables may not be properly configured for production
- Auth redirects using hardcoded localhost URLs

## Files Affected
- `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` (line 62)
- `src/app/auth/register/page.tsx` (line 62)
- `.env.local` and `.env` files
- Production deployment configuration

## Solution Required
1. **Add missing environment variables**
   - Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to environment configuration
   - Ensure all required variables are documented
   - Create production environment template

2. **Update auth redirects**
   - Replace hardcoded localhost URLs with environment variables
   - Ensure proper fallback values
   - Test redirects in different environments

3. **Create environment documentation**
   - Document all required environment variables
   - Create example environment files
   - Add validation for required variables

## Implementation Steps
1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to `.env.local`
2. Update auth redirect URLs in login and register pages
3. Create `.env.example` with all required variables
4. Add environment variable validation
5. Update deployment documentation
6. Test auth redirects in development and production

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All required environment variables are documented
- [ ] Auth redirects use environment variables instead of hardcoded URLs
- [ ] `.env.example` file exists with all required variables
- [ ] Environment variable validation is in place
- [ ] Production deployment works with proper environment configuration

## Testing
- Test auth redirects in development
- Test auth redirects in production
- Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
- Test with missing environment variables (should show helpful errors)

## Dependencies
- None (can be done independently)

## Notes
This ensures proper configuration for production deployment and prevents runtime errors due to missing environment variables.
